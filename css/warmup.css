/* WITHOUT MODIFYING THE HTML, add CSS rules to produce the following (eye-searing) style: 

* The header should have a background-color of 'tomato', and the text of its font should be 24pt.
* The articles should have a background-color of 'lightgreen'
* The appendix should have a background-color of 'violet'
* Headings should have font-family of 'Helvetica', but the body text (the lorem ipsum stuff) should have a font-family of 'Times New Roman'
* Asides should also have a font-family of 'Helvetica'.
* The list in the appendix should also have a font 'Times New Roman'
* The section that is selected and appendix item that is referenced should both be colored white.
* Hyperlinks should be the same color whether or not they have been visited.
* Bonus: have hyperlinks grow to 120% of their size when hovered or focused

Challenge: Try to do this with as few rules as possible!
